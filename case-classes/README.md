## CaseClasses

Implement functions to extract data from `Person` case classes. We'll be getting the name, if the person is Canadian, and the names of all people who are from a specified country. Please attempt to use pattern matching instead of built-in functions.

Also, the `names_from` function can be tricky. Remember our work last week to use recursion to process lists. It also may be helpful to look up **_stable identifiers_** in the context of pattern matching.

Run the tests with `sbt test`.
