## Scala Group

This repo contains the source code and tests for a Scala project group. It's like a book club, except we write code and make tests pass in between sessions.

- Week 1 - Workstation setup
- Week 2 - [Hello World](hello/)
- Week 3 - [List Ops](list-ops/)
- Week 4 - [Case Classes](case-classes/)
